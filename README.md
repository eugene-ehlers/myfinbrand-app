# OCR & Analysis Service — Frontend Foundation

This repository contains a minimal **3-page React (Vite) app** to establish a stable base:
- Landing (Home)
- Page Two
- Page Three

It includes a shared header, footer, and routing. We’ll add OCR features and AWS integrations later.

## Tech
- React 18 + Vite
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS

## Quick start
```bash
npm ci        # or: npm install
npm run dev   # open the printed localhost URL

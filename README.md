# OCR & Analysis Service — Frontend Foundation

This repository hosts the **frontend foundation** for the OCR & Analysis Service.
It provides a clean 3-page React (Vite) app structure with a shared header, footer, and routing.

The goal of this setup is to establish a minimal, stable base before layering in OCR features, data flows, and integrations.
